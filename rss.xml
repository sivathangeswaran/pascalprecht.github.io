&lt;p&gt;One thing I really like about Hackflix is that Davy and his super professional team try to create a very high quality experience. Check out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTWlh9Z37_f97y0a0_cjRBw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for more super interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, watch the episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaXMMIVZbyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we had a good start and actually managed to write a few chapters, we got side-tracked by our main business, which was training software developers all around the world in various technologies, and put the book to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many people out there using git and most of them certainly get away with typical workflows like adding, committing, pushing and pulling changes. Some of them manage to survive merge conflicts without being scared to “mess things up”. However, the majority of software engineers (and any git user for that matter), feels rather uncomfortable when using the tools, especially when just knowing how to add and commit changes is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to resurrect the book we planned to write many years ago and give it a whole new identity. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rebase-book.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Introducing REBASE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;REBASE cover&quot; src=&quot;/media/rebase-cover.png&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 650px&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REBASE not only aims to teach git users how to take back control of their commit histories through rebasing, but also to take away the fear of git being a super complex tool where “undoing things” is rather hard. With short and to the point chapters, hand-drawn illustrations and a pinch of simplicity, REBASE enables every reader to master git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, you don’t have to wait too long. I set myself a deadline to publish the book within two months. &lt;strong&gt;A first version will be available on 31 January 2020.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebase-book.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rebase-book.com&lt;/a&gt; and preorder the book!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Impact of Meditating every day]]></title><description><![CDATA[Meditation has changed my life and in this article I talk about how.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/meditating-every-day</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/meditating-every-day</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Meditation can open up surprisingly many doors when it comes to being more aware, mindful, focused and just at peace with yourself. I try to meditate &lt;a href=&quot;a-productivity-manifesto&quot;&gt;every morning&lt;/a&gt; for about 15 minutes and been doing that for quite some time now. Originally, I tried to find a way to deal with anxiety, however, after such a long time of practing meditation, I get to observe how my mind and character have changed beyond my original motivation, which I find quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this article I’d like to share how meditating every day has changed the way I think, the way I judge, the way I deal with people, the way I react to (external) stimuli, and pretty much the way I live my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-meditate&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-meditate&quot; aria-label=&quot;why meditate permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why meditate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons why people meditate, ranging from dealing with stress and anxiety to being more mindful, focused, and present (in the moment) every day. I first started meditating pretty unregularly out of curiosity after seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/igorminar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Igor Minar&lt;/a&gt;’s talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGeaXo2ZBr0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;(Super)Power Management&lt;/a&gt;, in which he also mentions one of my favorite books &lt;a href=&quot;/favorite-books#search-inside-yourself-the-unexpected-path-to-achieving-success-happiness-and-world-piece&quot;&gt;Search Inside Yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, I soon became part of the group of people that practiced meditation due to stress and anxiety. In fact, for several years during my time of travelling the world and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;teaching Angular&lt;/a&gt; at thoughtram, I had to deal with a series of anxiety and panic attacks that were most likely triggered by stress and me simply being burned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the worst experiences I had was when I was giving a talk at a conference about two years ago. The moment I went on stage my heart rate went up, a thousand thoughts went through my head, I felt out of breath, couldn’t think, let alone speak, straight anymore and just wanted to stop and leave. It’s probably hard to notice when watching the talk now, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PNbAY_eCems?t=52&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;first three minutes&lt;/a&gt; of it were horrible in my head and the feeling kept coming back a few times throughout the talk. A panic attack on stage in front of over 500 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event lead me to picking up meditation regularly again and getting a better understanding of how my mind and body works. I’m glad to say that ever since, I haven’t had any major panic attacks and on top of that, I’m overall happier in life, I’m much more calm and react much better to situations in life like keeping a cool head in heated discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever motivates you to give it a try, it’ll be most likely time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-does-it-work&quot; aria-label=&quot;how does it work permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking you have to sit with closed eyes and crossed legs on the ground, saying ”&lt;em&gt;Ooommhhhhh…&lt;/em&gt;” out loud for an hour or so. That is really not the case. You can totally do it, but it’s not necessary. Meditation is all about &lt;strong&gt;being aware&lt;/strong&gt; of how your body feels and the thoughts that go through your head without judging or getting caught up in them. Often, this is done by focusing on a certain part of your body, like the breath or your feet, legs, arms, hands and chest etc. At the end of the day, what you’re aiming for is to keep bringing your attention back to what you’re focusing on, everytime you notice your mind has drifted off. There’s also no requirement to do it for a long time. Just a few minutes every day can already make a difference. There’s even little exercises and techniques that can be applied for just a few seconds, multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally there’s no right or wrong, which makes the whole activity very rewarding. I personally am looking very forward to my meditation session every morning because I know there’ll be 15 minutes of relaxation for my mind. Just keep in mind that it takes some time and practice to get used to focusing on, for example your breath, while your brain is bored and craves for distraction. It’s not unusual to have bad days either, where your mind seems distracted all the time and you can’t manage to focus for just a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;I recommend using one of the great apps out there that guide you through your meditation sessions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android&amp;#x26;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wakingup.android&amp;#x26;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Waking Up&lt;/a&gt; (no affiliation, I just use those myself). They both come with free sessions that can be used infinitely, so you don’t have to go all-in and get an annual subscription right away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, here are some of the things that I’ve observed and noticed in my body, mind and character over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;calmness-and-serenity&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#calmness-and-serenity&quot; aria-label=&quot;calmness and serenity permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Calmness and Serenity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a quite active and impatient personality by nature. I used to rush a lot of things, whether it’s life or work, things had to be done quickly so I could move on to the next thing. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s also core to what lead to all the stress and anxiety I’ve experienced in the past years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the biggest changes I’ve noticed is that my mind is overall much more calm. Being calm turns out to be a very good foundation for all things in life! I no longer rush to work on my bike every morning, instead, I enjoy the ride and am more aware of all the people, streets and houses I’m passing by (given that it’s not raining of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to discussions, I can give much more constructive feedback and don’t get too attached to the topic at hand. When I have a lot of things on my plate for the day, instead of getting overwhelmed and stressing out, I just take it one step at a time, at a pace that’s comfortable for me. &lt;a href=&quot;a-productivity-manifesto#focus-and-execution&quot;&gt;Bullet journaling&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember having a chat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThomasBurleson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Thomas Burleson&lt;/a&gt;, about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thoughtram&lt;/a&gt; puts out so many &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thoughtram.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; at such a high pace. After I explained him the process, he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, life is not a race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I now understand what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-listening&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#better-listening&quot; aria-label=&quot;better listening permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Better listening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I used to let my thoughts out as soon as they popped up in my head without letting the other person finish their sentence; whether it’s during an argument or simply when the person asked for advice. Despite not being the most polite thing to do, my intention is usually to express my understanding or confusion, and since there’s a lot of empathy I have the urge to let them know my thoughts as soon as possible. Similar things could happen when people tried to build up to questions - I think I know what the question is going to be so I try to answer it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it’s different. I no longer immediately try to respond, instead, I listen. And I keep listening. Even when you’re done, I’ll be listening. At least for a few moments. It’ll give both of us space. Space for you to finish your train of thoughts, maybe you want to add one or another thing. Space for me to process what you’ve said and carefully craft a response that hopefully addresses your concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a couple of nice effects as well. The other person will feel and appreciate that there’s “room” to talk and to express what needs to be expressed. It also shows that you’re indeed actively listening and on top of that, you’re taking the time to give a meaningful response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how this can make nearly every discussion in your daily life constructive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;letting-go&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#letting-go&quot; aria-label=&quot;letting go permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Letting go&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not judging anything is one of the key concepts in meditation. Thoughts will come and go. Bad ones and good ones. Some will trigger emotions, others won’t. When these thoughts come up, it’s kind of like watching them from far away without really doing anything about it. No action required, no judgment needed. It’s that moment when we bring our attention back to what we’ve focused on (often the breath). The same applies to feeling tension, heavyness or lightness in the body. It’s not about whether we think it’s good or bad, it’s just about being aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that I’m judging things in my environment much less. It’s almost as if I’m completely neutral to any external stimuli that other times made me react in a certain way, like feeling anxious and offended or getting aggravated. Even things like getting to know new people becomes a completely different game if you don’t (sub)consciously start making up a picture in your head based on your impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting feeling of &lt;strong&gt;curiousity&lt;/strong&gt; that comes with it, which makes me feel humbled throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-creates-headspace&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#it-creates-headspace&quot; aria-label=&quot;it creates headspace permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It creates “Headspace”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might have noticed that a lot of the experiences I’ve mentioned boil down to pausing, slowing down, and creating mental space. It’s interesting how these few, very simple, things can affect pretty much every aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s really just a few moments, all of a sudden there’s time to enjoy the now, there’s time to listen, there’s time to make decisions, and there’s time to be aware of your mind, your body and your surroundings. It’s like watching a movie in a higher resolution on a really good screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could you say no to that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to finish this article by saying that, by no means is my life now all about rainbows and unicorns. It might have sounded a little bit like it, but meditation doesn’t take you to a parallel universe in which everything is just fine. Life will still be hard at times and there’s going to be moments in which I just want to throw everything out of the window. However, at least I now have better tools to deal with such situations. Tools I don’t want to miss anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Effects of leaving the comfort zone]]></title><description><![CDATA[An article about effects I've observed when leaving my comfort zone.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/effects-of-leaving-the-comfort-zone</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/effects-of-leaving-the-comfort-zone</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s been about a year since I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;a-new-start&quot;&gt;the urge to challenge myself&lt;/a&gt; and do something different to leave my comfort zone. Shortly after that, I &lt;a href=&quot;joining-status&quot;&gt;joined the Embark team at Status&lt;/a&gt; and it’s been a very interesting ride so far. A new technology, a new environment, a new industry, a new scope to work on, a new audience to work with. There are probably a lot of other things that were (and still are) “new” to me. Taking this step was one of the biggest shifts in my life and I would say I’m just half-way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently I’ve resigned from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Developer Experts&lt;/a&gt; program that I’ve been part of for years, putting down the badge of “being an expert” in a certain field which surely contributed to my developer reputation in one way or another. In addition to that, I’ve decided to learn the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rust programming language&lt;/a&gt; with zero experience in systems programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, leaving the comfort zone is not just about work. As I’m writing this article, I’m sitting in the train on my way back home. I attended a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bjjglobetrotters.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Camp&lt;/a&gt; for a full week, with about 300 people. Considering that I’m still very new to this sport and don’t know anybody in that space, this was certainly a very interesting experience as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m bringing all this up is that I’ve observed some interesting effects that resulted from those uncomfortable actions and I thought it might be worth sharing, so other people can learn about the possible upsides and downsides of it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few thoughts that might lead you in the right direction when it comes to trying something you always wanted to do, but makes you feel uncomfortable just even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;itll-be-a-bit-scary-at-first&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#itll-be-a-bit-scary-at-first&quot; aria-label=&quot;itll be a bit scary at first permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’ll be a bit scary at first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably obvious but I believe it does make sense to raise awareness about this. When I decided to change the field I’m working in and also switch from front-end development to anything that doesn’t necessarily involve any kind of front-end at all, I felt very vulnerable and anxious. I can’t even say that I haven’t had any experience with, for example, back-end development before. However, having done mostly web development for the past 10 years or so, out of which seven years have been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, I lost a fair amount of confidence on whether I’ll be able to pull off anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor that made it quite uncomfortable was that I haven’t done any “serious” programming in years, since I was working as a trainer &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;teaching others&lt;/a&gt; how to use the tools that I was good at, as opposed to actually building applications with real-world challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things can pile up and make you question yourself and your skillset. This can be very depressing at times when you start doubting what you’re capable of, however, always keep in mind that this is part of the game. You’re literally stepping &lt;strong&gt;out of&lt;/strong&gt; what’s convenient and intend to do something that probably requires you to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;youll-get-grounded-again&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#youll-get-grounded-again&quot; aria-label=&quot;youll get grounded again permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You’ll get grounded (again)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the natural effects of doing something outside your comfort zone is that you have to accept that you’re most likely surrounded by or working with people that are way better at what you’re doing. Hence, feeling less “smart” than the rest and asking a lot of (simple/beginner) questions repeatedly is going to be part of your daily actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a GDE specialized in Angular, people came to me with their questions regularly, or asked for my advice when it came to building and architecting certain things. At conferences, I obviously wanted to live up to that expectation as well and made sure that what I’m speaking about is either unexplored by the community or covers a technical topic in-depth. I would argue that, in a position like this, where you’re known for producing high-quality content, it is much easier to make people listen to you and feel confident that what you’re doing is indeed the right way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping away from that and doing something I had no clue about was very refreshing and made me realize again what it feels like to attend a conference as non-speaker, to join community channels and ask for help, to invest time in reading books to learn new things and to not be the guy in the room that supposedly knows “everything” (not that I ever said or believed I did, but hopefully you get what I mean).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging that you’re a beginner again and leaving your ego at the door before you enter the room is probably the best position to be in if you want to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;confidence-comes-back-one-step-at-a-time&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#confidence-comes-back-one-step-at-a-time&quot; aria-label=&quot;confidence comes back one step at a time permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Confidence comes back one step at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you did something that you were completely unsure about whether you could do it and after a little while you actually managed to do exactly that thing? How did it feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, it can be very overwhelming when we’re faced with a task or challenge that we don’t have any experience with. It’s super natural, we’re doing something new after all. As mentioned earlier, there’ll be times where you’ll be questioning your skills and your confidence will suffer. However, the nice thing about “starting from scratch” is that there’s opportunities to rebuild that confidence one step at a time. Things might go slow at first, but with every little achievement you’ll get better at it and realize “Wow, I can actually do this!“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had those moments plenty times in the past months and it’s a great feeling to have. It’s very motivating and you’re more likely to take on other, bigger challenges, and at the same time it makes you feel proud that you managed to bite the bullet and work your way through as well. How rewarding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-then-theres-growth&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#and-then-theres-growth&quot; aria-label=&quot;and then theres growth permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And then there’s growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure: if you don’t step out of your comfort zone, you most likely won’t grow. That doesn’t mean that you have to go ahead and change your job to become a better person. It’s obviously possible to grow within a field as well. From my experience however, I can tell that doing something that isn’t necessarily related to what I’m used to, amplifies the growth a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new environment comes often with new people, so you’ll learn how to deal with those different characters. This is great to revisit your biases and opinions, and helps developing better empathy. Solving new problems and challenges will activate different parts of your brain that will train your overall approach to challenges in life as well, since your experience will enable you to generalize a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a developer, learning a new programming language and committing to it for about a year or so is a great way to test this out. With a new programming language, there’s also a new community, a new environment, new challenges and different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always keep in mind, we’re not replacing one thing with another. What actually happens is that we keep &lt;strong&gt;adding&lt;/strong&gt; new things to our portfolio of what makes us the human we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#some-closing-thoughts&quot; aria-label=&quot;some closing thoughts permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the feeling you’re in some way left behind and have trouble catching up with everything, doing something completely different in life can open up a whole new world of opportunities to learn and grow. Just keep in mind to do things one step at a time, don’t overwhelm yourself with too many things and changes. The steps I’ve taken in my life also didn’t happen all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider every step outside of your comfort zone as an opportunity to extend your personal horizon with interesting adventures ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that not sound exciting?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joining the Embark Team at Status]]></title><description><![CDATA[I'm joining the Embark team at Status.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/joining-status</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/joining-status</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 12:46:50 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/a-new-start/&quot;&gt;I wrote about that I’m looking for a change&lt;/a&gt; and some fresh air in my career. After spending quite some time learning about building decentralized applications on top of blockchain platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethereum.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; and contributing to projects like IPFS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aragon.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Aragon&lt;/a&gt;, I’m happy I’ve got the opportunity to join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://embark.status.im&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt; team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.im&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Status&lt;/a&gt; as a Software Engineer to help pushing this space forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard about Embark before, it’s a framework and development environment for building and deploying decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform. Embark aims to be as fast, easy to use and flexible as possible by supporting decentralized storage systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; and communication protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/127/what-is-whisper-and-what-is-it-used-for&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also the go to platform to use when designing and building apps that run inside the Status app and will be a core API for Status’ upcoming Studio project, an integrated developer environment and education platform for Ethereum developers (sorry, no link, as it’s super early stages 🙃). Have a look at Embark’s repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embark-framework/embark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be working on implementing new features, creating extensions (for VSCode 😎), maintaining the codebase and improving the developer experience so that building decentralized applications becomes even more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re wondering, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thoughtram&lt;/a&gt; isn’t going anywhere. We have great trainers that will continue providing high-quality workshops. In fact, I’ve stepped back from doing training for a few months now (as mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/a-new-start/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) and it’s working very well. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://machinelabs.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MachineLabs&lt;/a&gt; is still open source and awaiting your contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on Embark is going to be a new challenge for me and I’m looking forward to working with the existing team of super talented engineers, learning more about Ethereum app development and contributing my part to the overall decentralization movement for a better world!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Improving your Open Source experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ever wanted to know how to get your first Pull Request merged?

&lt;p&gt;Creating a healthy and inclusive environment for everyone in the world of open source can be hard and often requires a long breath and patience. The approaches and tips I’m sharing here may or may not work for you, however I do believe that most of the time it pays out and will have a positive impact for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to learn how to increase chances that your first pull request to your favourite repository on GitHub gets merged, or how to get more contributors involved and keeping them engaged for your own projects, read on! 👌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re contributing for the very first time in your life, the first time to a particular project, or you’re a veteran in getting your changes into other people’s codebases. There are some simple approaches and tricks that not only make you more familiar with the codebase you’re interested in contributing to, but can also increase your authority and trust from peer developers as you go along and interact with everyone involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-trivial-issues&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#find-trivial-issues&quot; aria-label=&quot;find trivial issues permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Find trivial issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it has already become kind of a good practice and trend to have issues labelled as “First timer” in repositories on GitHub. Those are probably the first you want to take a look at when contributing to a project for the first time. Even if no such label exists, take the time and browse through existing issues. See if you can find anything you think you could fix or implement. It’s okay to not introduce a new major feature with your first contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation, small bug and typo fixes are good too! Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1415&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;my first pull request for the IPFS project&lt;/a&gt;, just to give you an idea. If you can’t find an issue that you feel comfortable with, try to reach out to the maintainers of the project and ask them if they can point you to a place were you can start looking into things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;propose-early&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#propose-early&quot; aria-label=&quot;propose early permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Propose early&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve found something you can work on, take your first stab on it. It doesn’t have to be perfect with the first try. In fact, I believe you’ll be much better off by getting a first rough draft of your changes done and propose them with a pull request as soon as you can for early feedback. That way you can signal early on that you’re working on this issue. As a matter of fact, you might have already implemented it, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;elaborate-where-needed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#elaborate-where-needed&quot; aria-label=&quot;elaborate where needed permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Elaborate where needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be quite hard to follow what the intentions were when somebody wrote a particular code. Of course, when working with platforms like GitHub, this may be a bit easier, as there’s usually an issue that you can refer to in your pull request, however, there’s often some implementation detail that needs clarification. Sometimes, you may even find yourself in a situation where you’re not entirely sure whether you should implement your thing one way or the other, as both come with advantages and disadvantages (as everything in life). Do yourself a favour and just go with one way for now. Attach comments to your pull request, clarify and elaborate why you made certain decisions and show that you considered other solutions as well and that you’re happy to change your proposal accordingly if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;iterate&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#iterate&quot; aria-label=&quot;iterate permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Iterate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve come already very far. You proposed changes, you made comments and elaborated on things that might need consideration and ideally, the maintainers reviewed your pull request and asked you to adjust a few things here and there. This is where you can shine. Show that you’re responsive, go through the change requests and update your pull request. Keep doing this until everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer to either just committing work-in-progress commits on top of the PR, for better transparency, or, if the PR is rather small, I rebase the commits right away. Either way, before the PR gets merged, it’s good to get the commits in your PR in shape, so that they have proper semantic meaning. This however, also depends on the project and how maintainers prefer their commit histories. Some don’t even care so much. Always good to show that you care though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-explicit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#be-explicit&quot; aria-label=&quot;be explicit permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Be explicit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least for scenarios where you create your own issues, either with questions, bug reports or feature requests, make sure to take the time and be as explicit as you can. If you’re posting a question, make sure to give enough context so that even other users in the space will understand where you’re coming from and what your question is about. They may be able to help as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s a bug report, explain the exact steps that cause the thing you think is a bug, ideally attach a minimal reproducible demo so maintainers have an easier time following what’s going on. It also shows that you don’t just dump a bug there, but actually put time and effort into making very clear why you think something is broken and how it can be reproduced. If it’s a feature request, always keep in mind that chances are high you’re not the only one using the project. Make sure the use case for your feature is generic enough so that it makes sense for others as well. Ideally propose what the new API could look like and how it can be used. Features that only cover your particular use case and don’t make sense to anybody else have a very low chance to be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this should help you getting your changes into your favourite projects. Of course, every project is different and also maintainers may expect different things from their contributors, so always make sure to constantly check on what’s the desired outcome when you work on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also brings us to the next section of this post. Doing open source from the perspective of maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-maintainers&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#as-maintainers&quot; aria-label=&quot;as maintainers permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As maintainers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot we can do as maintainers to keep our project’s users engaged and contributors happy. Everything described here should work for newly started open source projects, as well as high activity projects with an already existing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-it-as-easy-as-possible&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#make-it-as-easy-as-possible&quot; aria-label=&quot;make it as easy as possible permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Make it as easy as possible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like an obvious thing but is probably one of the harder tasks when it comes to getting open source right. If your goal is to get more people involved, that use your code or even contribute to it, the best way to get there is to make it as easy as possible. This means that you provide all the information that is needed to get the task done. In other words, make sure you have a well written documentation that shows how your tool can be used, what the different options are and which use cases users may look for. My first successful open source project was &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular-translate.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;angular-translate&lt;/a&gt; and putting most of my time into documentation (even different languages!) had the biggest impact when it comes to user adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#be-responsive&quot; aria-label=&quot;be responsive permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Be responsive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most important things when it comes to making an open source project successful. Be responsive and show your contributors that you’re there to help. Nothing is more discouraging than pull requests or issues with questions that don’t get a single response in weeks or even months. I know it’s super hard to stay on top of things, especially when a project is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel you don’t have an answer to a question or it may even be rather misplaced on platforms like GitHub, tell your contributors where to post their questions best and refer to chat rooms and StackOverflow. In fact, delegating questions to community chat rooms is a great way to keep your community involved and have them help each other without yourself being the only source for answers. You can also use GitHub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;issue and pull request templates&lt;/a&gt; to get those things right out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;provide-help-as-much-as-you-can&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#provide-help-as-much-as-you-can&quot; aria-label=&quot;provide help as much as you can permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Provide help as much as you can&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be very very hard to find your way through a code base you haven’t created yourself. Coding styles can vary a lot and sometimes it’s even hard to find the right spot where things need change. Depending on the project it can also be simply very overwhelming when there are many components and parts involved. Your contributors feel exactly like that when they start helping out. It will take them time to get used to everything and chances are high they might not be aware of certain APIs that might’ve better been reused instead of introducing that new function in their first pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a maintainer it’s your job to make this experience as pleasant as possible. Point contributors to the right spots where they have to start digging, raise awareness of APIs that are probably involved and give them a rough idea of what needs to be done. If you want your contributors to stay or even come back, make them feel welcome and show that you’re happy they offer a helping hand, all the time! To give you and idea, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embark-framework/embark/issues/816#issuecomment-423136233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here’s a comment&lt;/a&gt; where I tried elaborating on what the original issue was all about. It doesn’t have to be that detailed all the time, but offering support on this level will show your contributors that you’re in this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-patient&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#be-patient&quot; aria-label=&quot;be patient permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Be patient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes hand in hand with the previous point. Open source can be very frustrating, especially when you get the feeling that your peers don’t put the needed effort into the task at hand and give you the feeling you’re the one that has to fix and do things eventually. It’s okay, I’ve been there too. However, it will never improve the situation to react impatiently on platforms like GitHub, especially because it’s often hard to get the right emotions across in written communication. Give your users and contributors time to digest, keep offering a helping hand even if you have to repeat yourself. It will pay out in the long run. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter whether you’re a maintainer or contributor, if there’s one thing I want you to take away from this post, it’s that it’s key to stay positive throughout the journey. When you contribute, be nice. Be open minded. Adjust yourself to fit the rest of the project you’re contributing to and people will greatly accept you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you maintain, the same thing applies. Be nice to your contributors. Make them feel good about the work they’re doing for you. When giving feedback, always make it as constructive as you can. This is especially useful when reviewing pull requests, but also when collaborating on issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a rule I follow that works very well for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every change request, propose at least one alternative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, that we shouldn’t just say what we don’t like and why, but also tell our peers what a good alternative would be and how it can improve the situation. In practice, this often drives very nice discussions without anyone feeling hurt to rejected. 🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, that’s all I’ve got. Let me know how it goes for you!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Productivity Manifesto]]></title><description><![CDATA[My personal manifesto on how to stay focussed throughout the day. Make it yours!]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/a-productivity-manifesto</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/a-productivity-manifesto</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Aug 2018 13:00:09 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62899927-pascal-precht&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;quite a few books&lt;/a&gt; on productivity, lifestyle and mindfulness, and applying, integrating and practicing my learnings for quite a while in my daily life, I thought it would be useful to write down my thoughts on what works well for me in terms of getting things done throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s tons of productivity articles and resources out there and I’m sure some of my experiences overlap with what you’ve probably read somewhere else. However, this isn’t supposed to be just yet another post on productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;strong&gt;this is my personal manifesto&lt;/strong&gt; that I can come back to, to remind myself of how to stay focused and stay on track. The manifesto consists of just a few rules that are categorised by even less sections. I try to keep it as focused and to the point as possible, free from distractions and unessential information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re invited to make it your personal productivity manifesto as well. I’ll keep this one updated and change it as I go along and feel the need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#lifestyle&quot; aria-label=&quot;lifestyle permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of ourselves, our bodies and minds have to be in a good state. That’s why I believe it’s perfectly fine and important to make our personal well being, physically and mentally, the highest priority to be productive throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A calm mind is a strong mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can’t think clear and our mind is swamped with too many thoughts, ideas and emotions that are distracting, it’ll be hard to get anything done and focus on the right things. We also have a much harder time leading or following discussions with peers in a reasonable way. Meditating on a daily basis once or twice not only helps us getting a clear mind but also make us appreciate the “now” and gain greater focus for the things we do. It doesn’t have to be long either. Even 5 minutes of being in the moment can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercising for at least half an hour every day already helps giving us more energy as it improves circulation and reduces stress. Whether it’s a full body workout or just a good run to put the heart rate up - it doesn’t really matter. Stay disciplined, do it regularly. I personally am not the kind of type that can go to a gym and lift weights. Simply doesn’t excite me. That’s why I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu about a year ago and ever since I train 3-4 times a week. Find what works for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resting is one of the most important factors when it comes to productivity. In fact, sleep improves our memory and cements what we’ve learned throughout the day (that’s why reading right before we go to bed is probably the best time to read). Lack of sleep and rest will never do good to us, even if we think we’re more productive when we work through the night. It only does harm to our bodies and health. Try to get at least seven hours of sleep every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brain works best when it’s taking a nice bath. Drinking a lot of water is a key for better concentration and focus. Also, it helps preventing headaches when we sit in front of the computer all day long. So, drink water. Loads of it. Or tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-and-execution&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#focus-and-execution&quot; aria-label=&quot;focus and execution permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Focus and execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas and the intention to get things done are great but are only 10% of the story and don’t get us anywhere, if we don’t actually sit down and do the things we want to do. The other 90% are the art of being disciplined and staying focused throughout the day so we can take it one step at a time to get closer to our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what keeps me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullet Journaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what your typical day looks like and how many different things you have to take care of, it can be very helpful to put your thoughts on paper to make room in your head for focus and concentration. I started bullet journaling and it helps me a lot to have a clear picture of what I have to work on and what my goals are for the day, week and month. If you’re doing regular stand-up meetings with your team at work, having a log of what you’ve done is very useful too! Bonus points: it relaxes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the “now”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often we worry about what happened in the past and what challenges we might face in the near or far future. Accept that it doesn’t matter at this point. Focus on what’s present right now and what needs to be done to move forward with the current state of things. Then move on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with the most important task&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to procrastinate when you know there’s something you need or want to do that is either boring, hard or simply takes you out of your comfort zone. In those situations we often start tricking ourselves by doing other things that aren’t essential right now and don’t have as much impact as the task that really matters at the moment. Don’t avoid it, rather start your day with the most important task. It’s okay if you spend a whole day on it. Often, the most important is also the hardest task. But it’s also what pushes things forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start small&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to do it all at once. You’re probably not even able to and that’s perfectly fine. Start small. &lt;strong&gt;Take it one step at a time. Iterate.&lt;/strong&gt; Things will get easier once you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s okay to say no. We don’t have to be available all the time. We don’t have to answer that one email immediately. We don’t have to speak at this conference every year. We don’t have to be in every single meeting. Eliminate everything that distracts you from getting your own essential tasks done. &lt;strong&gt;Less is more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s it&lt;/strong&gt;. I know, those are very few and very simple rules, however everything else that claims to make me more productive can be easily derived from those. As mentioned earlier, I’ll keep this updated and add new rules as I try things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☝ &lt;strong&gt;One last tip on being productive&lt;/strong&gt; ☝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop googling for how to be productive. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Content Identifiers in IPFS]]></title><description><![CDATA[A deep look at content identifiers in the IPFS protocol.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/content-identifiers-in-ipfs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/content-identifiers-in-ipfs</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 07:34:56 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; or watched one or the other talk or tutorial about it, you know that IPFS generates hashes for the data that’s being added to the network. While it might be obvious why that is (IPFS uses those hashes to identify content in the network), it’s less obvious how those hashes are being put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, there’s probably some &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/future-proofed-hashes-with-multihash/#so-what-are-hashes-again&quot;&gt;hash algorithm applied to data&lt;/a&gt;, however it turns out that IPFS goes far beyond that as it uses a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiformats.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multiformat&lt;/a&gt; protocols to create its &lt;strong&gt;content identifiers&lt;/strong&gt; and keep them future-proof, which I think is quite smart as we’ll soon learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Multiformat protocols is &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiformats.io/multihash/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multihash&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven’t heard about it before, I recommend heading over to my post on &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/future-proofed-hashes-with-multihash/&quot;&gt;future-proof cryptographic hashes&lt;/a&gt;, which talks about what the protocol is and why it exists. This post builds on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by getting a hash from IPFS for the content “Hello World”, by piping it through &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ipfs add&lt;/code&gt; (you can also create a file with the content first and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ipfs add&lt;/code&gt; on it as well, but I prefer to save this step):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ echo &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; | ipfs add -n
$ added QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; option is a cool trick to get a hash from IPFS without actually writing the data to disk. ☝🏼Also notice that IPFS outputs the hash twice. This is because it outputs the hash of the content and the path of the file it resides in. If there’s no path, like in our case, it uses the hash as path as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u&lt;/code&gt; it is. This content identifier, or short CID, for “Hello World” will always be the same as long as the content stays the same. While this is not too special, let’s see what happens if we do the same thing with different content. “Hello other world” for example, will output &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;QmcaHpwn3bs9DaeLsrk9ZvVxVcKTPXVWiU1XdrGNW9hpi3&lt;/code&gt;. Go, try it yourself! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticed something? Right, both hashes start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Qm&lt;/code&gt;. This is an important characteristic to be aware of - all hashes generated by IPFS start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Qm&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Spoiler alert&lt;/strong&gt;: this will change &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/337&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;once IPFS has moved to CIDv1b32&lt;/a&gt; which was not the case at the time of writing this post, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Qm&lt;/code&gt; prefix all about? The first thing we need to know is that there are multiple versions of CIDs. There’s CIDv0 and CIDv1. We’ll touch on what the exact differences are in a minute, but whenever we see a hash generated by IPFS that starts with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Qm&lt;/code&gt; we know we’re dealing with a CIDv0 hash. This is because a CIDv0 is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiformats.io/multihash/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multihash&lt;/a&gt; encoded in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Base58&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uhm… so why exactly do we know it’s a CIDv0? Now it’s useful to know what a Multihash is (again, if this is new to you read &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/future-proofed-hashes-with-multihash/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; first and come back 🙃)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we know it’s a Multihash, we also know that the first two bytes of the CID represent the hash algorithm type that was used to hash the original data, and the length of the data hash respectively, while the rest of the CID represents the actual hash of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hash-type&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;hash-length&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;hash-digest&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can verify this by transforming our “Hello World” hash from Base58 to Base16 (or hexadecimal) and comparing the first byte with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multihash/blob/master/hashtable.csv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multihash Table&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;122074410577111096cd817a3faed78630f2245636beded412d3b212a2e09ba593ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, to make it more clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;12 - 20 - 74410577111096cd817a3faed78630f2245636beded412d3b212a2e09ba593ca
&amp;lt;hash-type&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;hash-length&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;hash-digest&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first byte &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0x12&lt;/code&gt; represents &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sha2-256&lt;/code&gt; in the hash table, which means the hash digest is a SHA-256 hash! But it turns out this is not the whole story. If we try to verify this and use a SHA2-256 function to get a hash for “Hello World”, we’ll notice it doesn’t really add up…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ echo Hello World | shasum -a 256
$ d2a84f4b8b650937ec8f73cd8be2c74add5a911ba64df27458ed8229da804a26&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d2a84f4b8b650937ec8f73cd8be2c74add5a911ba64df27458ed8229da804a26&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;74410577111096cd817a3faed78630f2245636beded412d3b212a2e09ba593ca&lt;/code&gt;… so what’s going on there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research I’ve learned that IPFS is doing a little bit more work than just hashing the data and creating a multihash out of that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daviddias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;David Dias&lt;/a&gt;, team lead and researcher of the IPFS project, puts it quite nicely in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40998621/how-to-create-an-ipfs-compatible-multihash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this StackOverflow question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPFS chunks the given file into 256 KiB pieces&lt;/strong&gt; - This is not really the case for us right now as we deal with very little data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each chunk goes into a so called “DAG”&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Directed Acyclic Graph&lt;/a&gt;) node inside a so called “Unixfs protobuf”. More on that in a second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another dag is created&lt;/strong&gt; with links to all the chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…it does what?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, that was my reaction too. Lots of words in there that need to be demystified. I’ll go into more details on dags and protocol buffers in future articles, but to keep it very simple for now, IPFS basically serializes some metadata (is it a file? Is it a directory? What’s the size in bytes?) along with our original data. It then serializes &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; with more metadata (what other data is our data linking to?) and eventually multihashes &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sha2-256&lt;/code&gt; (which just happens to be the default hashing algorithm at the time of writing this post) and puts that in the resulting CID we see on the screen. The APIs mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/208#issuecomment-265221120&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; can be used to play with that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in order to get the hash digest that resides in the CID, we have to get that serialized data and pipe that through &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sha2-256&lt;/code&gt;. IPFS’ &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; API lets us do exactly that. First let’s inspect that serialized data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ipfs block get QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u | sed -n l
$ $
$ \022\b\002\022\fHello World$
$ \030\f$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This already shows us that there’s more than just the “Hello World\n” data. Now, let’s pipe this through &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sha2-256&lt;/code&gt; and see what happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ipfs block get QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u | shasum -a 256
$ 74410577111096cd817a3faed78630f2245636beded412d3b212a2e09ba593ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it is! At this point I’d like to make a shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_alanshaw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/553092/steven&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Steven&lt;/a&gt; who helped me figuring out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51655352/how-recreate-a-hash-digest-of-a-multihash-in-ipfs/51658540#51658540&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;last bit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if this was a bit hard to follow, no problem. It’s not required to know what’s going on behind the scenes to use the tool. Just keep an eye on future articles here that will take a closer look at these things 🙃.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that we’ve got a better idea of where those &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Qm*&lt;/code&gt; hashes come from, let’s quickly talk about how CIDv0 differs from CIDv1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;differences-in-v1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#differences-in-v1&quot; aria-label=&quot;differences in v1 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Differences in v1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content identifiers version 1 encode even more information than its predecessor in a very compact format. While CIDv0 encodes hash type, hash length and hash digest, a CIDv1 can be represented as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&amp;lt;mc&amp;gt;&amp;lt;mh&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mb&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multibase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multibase&lt;/a&gt; code - very similar to multihashes, there’s multibase codes that encode the base encoding type (base16, base32, base58, etc) and the base encoded data itself, into a single string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; is the CID version in use - this makes CIDs upgradable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mc&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multicodec&lt;/a&gt; type - similar to multihashes and multibases, just for codec types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mh&lt;/code&gt; is a Multihash - basically what we’re getting in CIDv0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these are very powerful properties. For example, since the base encoding type is part of the CID, one can easily transform CIDs into a base encoding that creates shorter hashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what base encoding you’re dealing with, take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/multibase.csv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multibase Table&lt;/a&gt; provided by the spec. Can you guess what encoding this hash uses? 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this post there was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/337&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ongoing effort&lt;/a&gt; to migrate CIDs to CIDv1 and with default base32 encoding (CIDv1b32), while still being backwards compatible with CIDv0. According to the linked issue, this is due to security considerations with sub domains, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb/issues/2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;experimental protocol handler API&lt;/a&gt; and to support legacy URIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about hashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the resurrecting &lt;a href=&quot;a-new-start&quot;&gt;post about starting new&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to document my learnings as I’m diving into projects that catch my attention in the decentralization space, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io&quot; title=&quot;IPFS website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren’t familiar with IPFS or haven’t heard of it, it’s basically a stack of (networking) protocols that enables a fully distributed file storage system to creates a faster, safer and more reliable web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashes play a big role in IPFS as they are used to address content in a distributed network, similar to how &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com&quot; title=&quot;Git website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; uses hashes to address commits, trees and binary objects inside a repository (yep, you probably use them on a daily basis, without noticing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a system relies on cryptographic hashes as fundamental building blocks, it’s pretty important to have an update strategy in mind in case the hash algorithms used are considered weak or insecure at some point. In this post I’d like to explore &lt;strong&gt;how the IPFS project takes advantage of “Multihashes”&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure hashes are upgradable and can co-exist in the same application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-are-hashes-again&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#so-what-are-hashes-again&quot; aria-label=&quot;so what are hashes again permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So… what are hashes again?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, let’s get this out of our way quickly. A hash is actually less scary than it sounds. It is really just a function that takes some arbitrary input and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string. What that alphanumeric string looks like depends on the given hash algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make up a simple hash function and say we have a message “abc” which is our input. Our custom hash function’s algorithm takes every character of the input message and moves it forward three letters in the alphabet. This will result in a hash digest “def”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HASH(&amp;#39;abc&amp;#39;) // &amp;#39;def&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it is. A hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we look at some real world hash functions, they do exactly the same thing (just that the algorithm is more complex obviously). Git for example uses SHA-1, which produces a 160 bit hash, &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/34995/why-do-we-use-hex-output-for-hash-functions&quot; title=&quot;Why do we use hex output for hash functions?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;usually rendered as a hexadecimal number&lt;/a&gt;, 40 digits long. It hashes raw content (binary data), tree objects and commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have Git installed on your machine, try it yourself! Simply run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ echo &amp;quot;abc&amp;quot; | git hash-object --stdin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The returned digest is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;8baef1b4abc478178b004d62031cf7fe6db6f903&lt;/code&gt;. And yes, a hash algorithm will always return the same hash for a given input. That’s how you can verify integrity when you receive data from a sender. However, it is impossible to derive the input from a hash. Super important characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be accurate here, it turns out that Git doesn’t actually hash the raw input, but prepends the input with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; followed by the size of the content before hashing. This isn’t important right now, but just in case you’re trying to verify the digest with e.g. OpenSSL’s SHA-1 implementation, you’ll notice it’ll return a different hash from ‘abc’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; want to dig deeper (like me), check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/552659/how-to-assign-a-git-sha1s-to-a-file-without-git/552725#552725&quot; title=&quot;How Git calculates the SHA1 for a file&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashes are the result of an algorithm transforming an input to a digest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithms return a fixed length (e.g. SHA1 returns 160 bit hashes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They always return the same hash value for a given input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is (or should be) impossible to derive the input from a hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, coming back to this “Multihashes” thing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-with-hashes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-problem-with-hashes&quot; aria-label=&quot;the problem with hashes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The problem with hashes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashes are really great. Due to their characteristics, we can use them to verify the integrity of content and data, plus, they can be very compact as well. Unfortunately though, sometimes they turn out to be not secure or strong enough (I’m looking at you, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MD5&lt;/a&gt;!), or attackers manage to break them. Not something that happens all the time, but it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a simple, but common scenario in which user passwords are stored in some database. Obviously, we don’t want to store passwords in plain text, that’d be a disaster for many different reasons I don’t think I have to mention here. Perfect use case for hashes right? So let’s go ahead and assume we store those passwords as MD5 hashes. Wonderful, many problems solved with a simple fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say, &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; hypothetically &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; 🙃, the next day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure&quot; title=&quot;Is MD5 considered insecure?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MD5 is considered insecure&lt;/a&gt;. What are are going to do? Well, we definitely have to upgrade our hash algorithm to something more secure. That turns out to be a challenge though, because we happen to deal with a large, maybe distributed, system and can only upgrade over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to slowly (but as fast as possible) upgrade to a different hash algorithm, while keeping the existing system in tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem that shouldn’t get less attention, is that existing systems often rely on APIs that simply assume a certain type of hash and its length. Think about how many Git repositories are out there with every single object being a 160 bit hexadecimal hash (40 digits). Imagine what happens when Git switches to SHA-2, a 256 bit hash and how many tools and applications would break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out problems like those can be avoid by introducing a versioning system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;versioned-hashes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#versioned-hashes&quot; aria-label=&quot;versioned hashes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Versioned hashes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple: introduce some version as part of the hash so the system can easily figure out what hash it is dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the ‘abc’ hash we calculated with Git earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;8baef1b4abc478178b004d62031cf7fe6db6f903&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is a password hash and we’d have to verify whether it is the correct password or not, we’d just compare this computed hash with the one in our database. However, as mentioned earlier, we want to migrate to a different hash algorithm without breaking the system. The same input as SHA-256 for example, looks quite different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BA7816BF8F01CFEA414140DE5DAE2223B00361A396177A9CB410FF61F20015AD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to know up front that we’re in fact dealing with a different hash version, we ca introduce a version number like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1:BA7816BF8F01CFEA414140DE5DAE2223B00361A396177A9CB410FF61F20015AD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also works great for systems that already use &lt;em&gt;unversioned&lt;/em&gt; hashes. Any hash without a colon must have been created before the version change. Any hash with a colon and version number can be handled in a respective way (stripping out the first two bytes (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1:&lt;/code&gt;) and assume the hash is a SHA-256 hash in this case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution can be scaled up and down in different ways depending on our needs. For example, if we’re in a scenario where we happen to deal with more than two hash types, we could introduce versions for each type like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sha1:0beec7b5ea3f0fdbc95d0dd47f3c5bc275da8a33
sha256:2c26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae
blake2:a96953281f3fd944a3206219fad61a40b992611b7580f1fa091935db3f7ca13d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3955223/password-hashing-how-to-upgrade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the way to go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do better though. While the above is a decent way to approach this challenge, there are still some things can turn into problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One obvious characteristic is that the version type might not be compatible with the rest of the hash type. For example &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is not a valid hexadecimal digit. However, Most systems transfer hashes in hex (or base32, base64 etc). So there’s added complexity when building apps on top of those schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case millions or billions of hashes have to be stored, long version types like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;blake2&lt;/code&gt; might have a considerable impact in terms of byte costs. A shorter streamlined version syntax may be better here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now it’s really time to dive into this Multihash thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;multihashes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#multihashes&quot; aria-label=&quot;multihashes permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Multihashes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Multihashes come into play. &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiformats.io/multihash/&quot; title=&quot;Multihash website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multihash&lt;/a&gt; is a protocol (used by IPFS) for differentiating outputs from various well-established hash functions. It works very similar to what we’ve just done, just that it adds a little bit of extra information in a smart way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Multihash has the following pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hash-func-type&amp;gt;&amp;lt;digest-length&amp;gt;&amp;lt;digest-value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hash-func-type&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; describes the hash function used - there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multihash/blob/master/hashtable.csv&quot; title=&quot;Multihash table&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hash table&lt;/a&gt; to see how the codes are mapped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;digest-length&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; describes the length of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;digest-value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;digest-value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the actual hash value we’re interested in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s take the following Multihash as an example and try to demystify it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;122041dd7b6443542e75701aa98a0c235951a28a0d851b11564d20022ab11d2589a8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice&lt;/strong&gt;: In hexadecimal code, two digits are equal to one byte. In other words, the first two digits, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;12&lt;/code&gt;, can be translated to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0001 0010&lt;/code&gt;. That’s why a 160 bit hash in hex code is a 40 digit number. Also, usually hex codes are prepended with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that it’s a hex code. In this case &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0x12&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned that the first byte identifies the hash function type. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multihash/blob/master/hashtable.csv&quot; title=&quot;Multihash table&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Multihash table&lt;/a&gt;, that would be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sha2-256&lt;/code&gt; (take a look yourself, it’s in the seventh row).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, the digest length (also in bytes). &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0x20&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;32&lt;/code&gt; in decimal, so at this point we already know the following hash value is 32 bytes (256 bits) long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important information to have. Remember the scenario where Git would switch from SHA-1 to SHA-256 ? Many apps and systems that work with Git hashes expect them to be 160 bit long. If Git used something like Multihash, apps could simply read out the length of the expected hash and keep it therefore variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the actual hash digest we’re dealing with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;41dd7b6443542e75701aa98a0c235951a28a0d851b11564d20022ab11d2589a8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, we basically have a single hash that is &lt;strong&gt;completely self-describing&lt;/strong&gt; and still addressable as it keeps the characteristics of any other cryptographic hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Multihash protocol these days is very easy as well. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiformats.io/multihash/#implementations&quot; title=&quot;Multihash implementations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;implementations for several languages&lt;/a&gt; like Go, Java, Rust, JavaScript and more! If you want to learn about Multihashes and the IPFS protocol stack (yes, there’s so much more), here are some resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy multihashing!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guess it's time for a new start]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some thoughts on leaving the comfort zone.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/a-new-start</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/a-new-start</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2018 06:51:44 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Wait… what? It’s been four years since my last post here on my blog? How did that happen… ah right, I spent the past years building &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io&quot; title=&quot;thoughtram website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thoughtram&lt;/a&gt; with my buddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter/cburgdorf&quot; title=&quot;Christoph Burgdorf on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Christoph&lt;/a&gt; and taught &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/thoughtram/people&quot; title=&quot;thoughtram organisation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;quite a few&lt;/a&gt; people &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io/git-master-class.html&quot; title=&quot;Git Master Class by thoughtram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;how to use Git&lt;/a&gt; and how to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html&quot; title=&quot;Angular Master Class by thoughtram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;web applications with Angular&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things have happened since then. While it was pretty quiet here, I wrote over 60 articles on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thoughtram.io&quot; title=&quot;thoughtram Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thoughtram blog&lt;/a&gt; (some of them you might have read, if you’re into Angular). I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWifOK_Wi8&amp;#x26;list=PLauX9TuJ8sfw6FH2doAbCi5Y-8GJHLqtb&quot; title=&quot;Pascal on Youtube&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;spoke at some conferences&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/2015/10/08/pascal-becomes-a-gde.html&quot; title=&quot;Pascal becomes a GDE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;became a Google Developer Expert&lt;/a&gt; for Web Technologies. Obviously there was a lot of travelling involved as well. I stopped counting the countries I’ve visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, about a year ago, we’ve started our next journey with &lt;a href=&quot;https://machinelabs.ai&quot; title=&quot;MachineLabs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MachineLabs&lt;/a&gt; in which we’re trying to make it easier for everyone to get started with Machine Learning. In order to achieve greater adoption and keeping things as transparent as possible, we even &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.machinelabs.ai/2018/03/21/machinelabs-goes-open-source/&quot; title=&quot;MachineLabs goes open source&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;open sourced the entire platform&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a lot of fun to build applications again and it’s even more fun to see a community building around the project, with people helping out making it better every day (wanna contribute? 👉🏼&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/machinelabs/machinelabs&quot; title=&quot;MachineLabs on GitHub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this way!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man… that’s a lot of stuff. Can’t believe all of this happened in the past four years. Anyways, it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-need-to-stretch-myself&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#i-need-to-stretch-myself&quot; aria-label=&quot;i need to stretch myself permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I need to stretch myself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching people all around the globe software technologies is really fun. In addition to that, you make a lot of new friends which is kind of a nice thing to have as well. I truly appreciate it. After doing this for so many years though, I really feel like challenging myself again and exploring different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why for the past few months, I started reading about the decentralization movement (yes yes, also your favorite blockchain) and related topics, such as peer-to-peer networking and cryptography. Turned out I actually really like cryptography, who would have thought…🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to what I’ve done over at thoughtram, I’d like to write about my learnings as I go along. To me, this is very exciting, because I’m kind of starting from scratch. I’m not the guy who’s built this super useful plugin for your favorite framework (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular-translate.github.io&quot; title=&quot;angular-translate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;angular-translate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;), and I’m certainly not carrying another GDE badge for being specialized in this field. Nobody really knows me in that space. It may sound weird, but it’s a really nice feeling to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1415&quot; title=&quot;First PR at the js-ipfs project on GitHub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;managed to land my first pull request&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot; title=&quot;IPFS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;IPFS project&lt;/a&gt; - thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Alanshaw&quot; title=&quot;Alan Shaw on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alan&lt;/a&gt;!🙏 It’s a small step but I’m very happy I found a way to get started. You can expect one or the other post about the project and its fundamentals in the upcoming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you wonder, yes I still like Angular and the community is probably the nicest one that I have ever been part of. Also, as I’m maintaining MachineLabs, I’m kind of doing Angular more or less on a daily basis. It even looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ng-be.org/conference-day&quot; title=&quot;NG-BE conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;I’ll be speaking about Angular&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the year as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m going to change my focus a little bit. I don’t have any concrete plans nor do I have an idea where this takes me. If the title of this post made you think Pascal is going to announce something big, I’m sorry to disappoint you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess it’s just time for a new start.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Integrating Web Components with AngularJS]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to integrate Web Component Technologies with the AngularJS framework.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/integrating-web-components-with-angularjs/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/integrating-web-components-with-angularjs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2014 11:09:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago I had the honour to give a talk together with the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/CarmenPopoviciu&quot;&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt; at the first european &lt;a href=&quot;http://angularjs.org&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; conference &lt;a href=&quot;http://ngeurope.org&quot;&gt;ngEurope&lt;/a&gt;. The title of our talk was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow! - AngularJS and Web Components”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about what Web Components are and if and how we can integrate them with the AngularJS of today, since this is a question that seems to be asked quiet often. We also talked about Angular 2.0 and how that version of the framework will embrace the Web Components technologies, so we had a nice overview of what issues can occur and how they are solved in the future. If you’re interested in the talk, the slides are up online &lt;a href=&quot;http://pascalprecht.github.io/dont-stop-thinking-about-tomorrow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and there’s also &lt;s&gt;going to be&lt;/s&gt; a video on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSTNTXtQwaY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;s&gt;I’ll update this post, once it’s online.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as you can probably imagine, 25 minutes are not enough to cover everything in detail about Web Components, the Angular of today and the Angular of tomorrow. This is why I decided to write a follow up article on what we’ve been talking about, to focus more on the things that probably missed out. I’ll not cover the Web Components technologies themselves since there are tons of resources out there in the web. This article focuses on the &lt;strong&gt;integration of Web Components with the AngularJS&lt;/strong&gt; of today and the AngularJS of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-simple-web-component&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#building-a-simple-web-component&quot; aria-label=&quot;building a simple web component permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Building a simple web component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump right into the topic and say we’ve built a web component that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Hello&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can probably imagine that this web component is evidently a sort of input element, that does a better job than the native &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. However, here’s what the implementation of it might look like, we start with the template (I don’t use Polymer in order to make clear that the stuff you read here should work with any web component, regardless if it’s implemented with a library like Polymer or not, as long as a few requirements are fulfilled. But we’ll get into this in a minute):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ground breaking hm? As you can see, all we do is having an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element in our template, however, you know we could do much more here. But for the sake of simplicity, we stick with this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the custom element definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; SpecialInputProto &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

SpecialInputProto&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;createdCallback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// getting initial value of value attribute&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;value&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;value&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; template &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;template&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// setting value property of input element&lt;/span&gt;
  template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; shadowRoot &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createShadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  shadowRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpecialInputProto&lt;/code&gt; prototype creates its own shadow root, checks for an initial &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute and feeds the templates &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with it. Finally it activates its template by cloning its contents into its Shadow DOM. Last but not least, we have to register our new custom element on the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;registerElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;special-input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  prototype&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; SpecialInputProto
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, our web component is now ready to use. But can we use it in an Angular app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-components-inside-angular-world&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#web-components-inside-angular-world&quot; aria-label=&quot;web components inside angular world permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Web Components inside Angular world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to build our own web components is of course a nice thing. However, coming from an Angular world, the first question that probably comes into our minds is, if we’re able to actually use this component in our Angular apps, even if it’s not a directive but a custom element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it’s not possible to say that it works out of the box per se and at the same time, it wouldn’t be fair to say that it’s not possible at all. Let’s go through all possible scenarios and see if we can find an answer. We start with the most simplest one: Using our web component in our Angular app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have some HTML code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;ng-controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;AppController&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Please enter your name:&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Pascal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty straight forward. We have a controller that creates a scope with an associated DOM element. What we also see is the usage of our fresh created web component with a hard coded &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Now the big question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes. And Carmen explained very well in the talk why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is DOM. Angular doesn’t know and shouldn’t know about custom elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Angular doesn’t even pick up our custom element since it’s not registered as directive and therefore not collected by the compiler. So for that simple case, we can just use our custom element. Also the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute is just a hard coded string, there’s nothing special with our custom element from the outside world so things do just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, fair enough but what happens when we assign an actual model value to our scope and use that to feed our custom element with data? Well, let’s take a look. First, the controller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;angular&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;myApp&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;AppController&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  $scope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Pascal&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we apply the interpolation directive to our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;special-input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;ng-controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;AppController&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Please enter your name:&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{{name}}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens now? Executing this code in our browser shows us, that our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;special-input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element gets &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{{name}}&lt;/code&gt; as string value and that’s it. It seems like the interpolation didn’t happen at all. The reason for that is, that our custom element doesn’t react on attribute changes yet. It gets the initial value, which is in fact &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{{name}}&lt;/code&gt; and when the interpolation happens, it doesn’t update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element inside the Shadow DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can fix that by extending our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpecialInputProto&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;attributeChangedCallback&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;SpecialInputProto&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;attributeChangedCallback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; oldValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; newValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;value&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shadowRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; newValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, everytime the value of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute of our custom element changes, it updates the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property of its Shadow DOM &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. If we run the example in our browser again, we see that our custom element picks up the change at runtime and is updated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just experienced the first important fact when it comes to integrating web components with Angular: if the web component doesn’t take care of reflecting attribute changes to corresponding properties, in our case the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element in the Shadow DOM, changes from the outside world do no appear inside the element. When building web components with Polymer, you don’t have to care about that logic, since it comes with built-in template binding that does the job for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now our custom element works even with interpolated attribute values in our Angular app. But does it work the other way around too? Are changes, that happen inside our custom element, reflected back to our model on the controllers scope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try it out and extend our example by adding another &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to our HTML that has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ng-model&lt;/code&gt; directive that is bound to our models &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;ng-controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;AppController&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Please enter your name (directive):&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;ng-model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Please enter your name (web component):&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{{name}}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing into our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; directive triggers a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$digest&lt;/code&gt; in the Angular world and updates the DOM, which in turn reflects the change in our custom element as well. But that we knew already. What happens when we type into our custom element? Yikes! The change happens &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; our custom element, which at the same time is &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; the Angular world, so Angular isn’t notified about the change. There’s no &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$digest&lt;/code&gt; triggered and our model isn’t updated. This again, brings us back to what Carmen said at ngEurope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is DOM. Angular doesn’t know and shouldn’t know about custom elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s the elements job to notify the outside world when a change happens inside the element. Which brings up the next big question: How can an element notify the outside world? To answer this question, we first have to understand what APIs an element provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-api-of-an-element&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#understanding-the-api-of-an-element&quot; aria-label=&quot;understanding the api of an element permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Understanding the API of an element&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every DOM element, no matter if native or custom, comes with four different APIs that developers can use to interact with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore these for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt; are the things we either use declaratively, when we write HTML code and tell our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element what its initial &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element what its &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; is, or imperatively using an elements &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; method. Attribute values are always interpreted as strings. So it’s not possible to set for example an object as attribute. Some native attributes update their corresponding property once they are set. For example, setting an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; elements &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute, updates its property with the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Properties&lt;/strong&gt; are the actual DOM object properties we can access imperatively through JavaScript. Every DOM object comes with its default properties but we are of course able to just define new properties on an object if we want. Properties also can have different values that just string. The following code updates the value of an inputs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; input &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;new value!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Element properties are not necessarily reflected back to their attributes. Some element properties do, some don’t. The value of an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; elements &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property does not reflect back to its attribute. An &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; elements &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; property does. Which means, if we set the value declaratively to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value=&amp;quot;Pascal&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and update the elements property to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Carmen&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, the attributes value is still &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Pascal&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. It’s also important to mention that, whereas element attributes are used to set initial values, properties are used to update values at runtime. Of course, this only works if there’s a corresponding property to an attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; can also be accessed imperatively by invoking them directly on an elements DOM object like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;p&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

p&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;title&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hello there&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events&lt;/strong&gt; are the things we listen to when we want to react on things like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;click&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, events are are the only natural way of an element to notify the outside world that something happened inside, like when an element is clicked or an inputs value changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that it’s always up to the element what its inner workings are and if it does things like (custom) event dispatching or attribute/property reflection or not. Now that we know what an elements APIs are, let’s see what we can do to inform Angular about changes in our custom element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notifying-the-outside-world&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#notifying-the-outside-world&quot; aria-label=&quot;notifying the outside world permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notifying the outside world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the APIs that an element comes with, it’s pretty much obvious what we can do to inform Angular about changes that happen inside our custom element, right? Dispatching a custom event like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;valueChanged&lt;/code&gt; everytime the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; element of our custom elements Shadow DOM is updated seems to be the way to go. But what does that mean from the outside world point of view? What do we have to do to actually react on such custom event that is fired in order to call &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$scope.$apply&lt;/code&gt; to trigger &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$digest&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. We have to create a new directive for that particular event, otherwise we’re not able to listen to it ”&lt;em&gt;The Angular Way&lt;/em&gt;”. And now imagine a custom element dispatches four different events depending on what happens. We would have to build four different directives for every single custom event. Next, multiply this with the amount of different custom elements you use in your Angular app. I think you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what else can we do to notify Angular? The Angular of today is not able to track changes on custom element properties. It also doesn’t see any attribute changes. It seems hopeless…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wait, the internet has this thing called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mutation Observer&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutation Observers can be used to observe mutations on the DOM. This includes things like insertions or removals of DOM elements, but also attribute changes. That means, we can create an observer that observes an elements attributes and whenever the observer sees a change, we can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$scope.$apply()&lt;/code&gt; to inform Angular about this particular change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out we don’t even have to build such a thing ourselves. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eee-c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chris Strom&lt;/a&gt; already built a directive called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eee-c/angular-bind-polymer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;angular-bind-polymer&lt;/a&gt; that does exactly what we need. It sets up mutation observers for all attributes that have an interpolation directive applied on that particular element, and triggers a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$scope.$apply()&lt;/code&gt; whenever a change on one of these attributes happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we have to do is to apply the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bind-polymer&lt;/code&gt; directive (yes, the name sounds Polymer specific, but it isn’t. I’ll tell you why in a minute) to the custom element that interacts with our Angular app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{{name}}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;bind-polymer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;special-input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird. It seems that typing into our custom elements &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; still doesn’t notify the outside world about its changes. Why that? Well, if we look closely, we see that we actually forgot something. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bind-polymer&lt;/code&gt; directive sets up observers that observe changes on the elements attribute, but our custom element doesn’t reflect changes back to its attributes when we type into its &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. That means, the observers callback isn’t called at all and no &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$digest&lt;/code&gt; is triggered. So what do we have to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to trigger the applied mutation observers, we have to make sure, that the changes are actually reflected back to the elements attribute. In our particular case that means, we have to set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;special-input&lt;/code&gt; whenever its &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; fires an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; event. Let’s update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;createdCallback()&lt;/code&gt; of our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SpecialInputProto&lt;/code&gt; accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;SpecialInputProto&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;createdCallback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ... creating shadow root etc...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shadow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;input&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;value&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we cloned the templates contents into our Shadow DOM, we query its &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; element and set up an event listener that updates our custom elements &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute whenever a change in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew. That’s it. Typing into our custom element now triggers a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$digest&lt;/code&gt; that syncronizes the scopes model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the next important fact when integrating web components with Angular: when relying on attribute changes with mutation observers, syncronization only works when the custom element reflects changes back to its attributes. In addition, from a custom element point of view and despite from the fact that it’s probably going to be used in an Angular app, there’s no real reason to reflect property values back to its attributes except for styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s also the reason why the README of the angular-bind-polymer project says ”&lt;em&gt;This only works with Polymer elements that use reflection&lt;/em&gt;”. Polymer comes with an API that lets you easily set up attribute/property reflection. All you have to do is to set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflect: true&lt;/code&gt; in a properties configuration and Polymer does the rest for you. That’s probably also be the reason why the project has a Polymer specific name. However, as we can see, reflection is nothing that is only restricted to web components built with Polymer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you now think ”&lt;em&gt;This is a horrible hack!&lt;/em&gt;” then you’re right. But it seems to be the most comfortable way, compared to creating directives for every single event, to integrate web components with the Angular of today. However, as we know, the Angular team works on a new version of Angular that embraces the power of Web Components technologies by default. Let’s see how these issues are tackled in the Angular of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-components-and-angular-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#web-components-and-angular-20&quot; aria-label=&quot;web components and angular 20 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Web Components and Angular 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angular 2.0 should be able to work with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; element. It shouldn’t matter if an element is a native element, or a custom element. It also shouldn’t matter what attributes it defines, or what events it fires. Let me bring up Carmens statement again (and seriously, let it sink in):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is DOM. Angular doesn’t know and shouldn’t know about custom elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make this happen, Angular needs a new generalized syntax that unifies native and custom events as well as custom and native property/attribute names. Today we use things like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ng-click&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ng-focus&lt;/code&gt; to react on events and Angular takes care of triggering a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$digest&lt;/code&gt; for us. However, as we discussed earlier, a custom element could dispatch a custom event that Angular doesn’t know about. To get around this, there’ll be a new template syntax that just works with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; event, no matter if custom or native.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;(click)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;doSomething()&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click me!&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code executes &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt; on the component when it’s clicked. As we can see, there’s no &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ng-click&lt;/code&gt;. Also, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; could be a custom event name as well. So &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(click)&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(skip)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(foo)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; symbols tell Angular that it’s an event expression. What about attributes and properties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learned, attributes are always interpreted as strings when it comes to elements (I’m not talking about directives!). However, in an Angular world, we want to be able to pass things like objects to components right? This is why Angular will try to bind to properties by default and falls back to attributes, if there’s no corresponding property. Properties can have any value. And since Angular embraces the declarative way of building apps, it comes with a new template syntax to declare property bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code shows how we can bind a value to a components property in HTML:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;[title]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;foo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; could be anything custom if the underlying element defines it. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; can now also be an object or primitive, which wouldn’t be possible with attributes. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; symbols tell Angular that this is a property binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;conclusion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating Web Components with the Angular of today doesn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; work. It is simply not designed to work with Web Components technologies out of the box. Even if there are ways to make it sort of work, it’ll always be a hack to rely on things like Mutation Observers, especially when keeping in mind that this work-around only works when the element reflects its changes back to its attributes. Also, creating directives for every single event that a custom element could fire, isn’t really a comfortable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we shouldn’t forget that this only applies to web components that need to notify the outside world. Components that just need data from the outside world, can be used right away along with Angular without any further hacks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pretty print JSON in Vim]]></title><description><![CDATA[Quick tip! Format JSON within Vim with a single command.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/pretty-print-json-in-vim</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/pretty-print-json-in-vim</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 11:09:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This post is rather a quick tip than a real article. I think I don’t have to give a specific context here, since the use case is clear: You’ve got some JSON from any resource and you want to inspect it for any reason. And since you’re a Vim user, of course you want to do that inside your Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. So now we have some JSON and we paste it into our Vim and because our mentioned resource doesn’t return pretty printed JSON, all we see is a big unreadable junk of JSON data in our buffer. How do we get this pretty printed? It’s as simple as running this command within Vim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-vim&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vim&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; json&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tool&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it, try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what’s happening here. We can actually split the command above into the following parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; - Brings you from Normal Mode into Command-Line Mode. Vim now waits for you to enter a command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; - A symbolic identifier to specify a range. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; defines a range from the first to the last line of the current buffer. You could also specify line numbers like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2,5&lt;/code&gt; which defines the range from line 2 to line 5. Another possible way to define a range is to use Visual Mode. Simply select your target lines and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;. This prepares the command line with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;,&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is the range definition for “Everything that has been visually selected”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; - Starting your command with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; lets you run any shell command from within Vim. Having a range selected before makes the shell using that as standard input stream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;python -m json.tool&lt;/code&gt; - The actual shell command. Here we run a Python library module &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;json.tool&lt;/code&gt; that does the actual work for us. The output of this command is sent back to your Vim buffer once executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this command only works if you have Python installed on your local machine. Unix machines usually come with a default Python installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I use Vim]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this article I talk about why Vim is my primary editor of choice.]]></description><link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/why-i-use-vim</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/why-i-use-vim</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 11:09:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first question you get asked by developers of a company when starting at a new gig (after saying hello to everyone and having the first coffee), is probably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what tools or IDE do you prefer when working with code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right? Developers should always be interested and curious about what other developers do to make their daily work as pleasant as possible. They may use tools, editors or IDEs you’ve never heard of and it probably turns out that these tools give you what you’ve always been waiting for. Productivity boosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we all want and what we should care about. Developers are lazy and very clever at the same time. We’re able to customize our environment to make it work in a way we want it to work. We spend a lot of time in thinking about how to automate repetitive tasks because we don’t want to repeat ourself over and over again. We try to make things with as less effort as possible to get as much things as possible done. We don’t want to waste time. We want to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I always see an amazed face when people ask me this question, because my answer is (and will probably always be):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I use Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, you mean this text editor nobody knows how to get out of? This editor, where I don’t even know how to type things into a file? You are kidding, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I mean exactly &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read this article right now, you are probably a Vim user. Because you want to know the reasons why somebody uses the same cool editor you use right? And that’s good. If you are not a Vim user, that’s even better. Because you are interested in what other developers do and use. Keep reading, you won’t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things clear, this post is not about saying that Vim is the answer to everything and you should switch your editors and IDE’s right now to be productive. It’s also not about saying that everything that is not Vim, is not as good as Vim. Whatever opinions come to your mind when reading this article, all I do here is explaining why I’ve chosen Vim as my primary editor for almost everything. If it doesn’t work for you, that’s okay. Just choose what works best for you. If it sounds interesting to you and you decide to try this editor, I’d be very happy to hear from your experiences and how things work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;climbing-the-wall-and-sliding-down-afterwards&quot;&gt;Climbing the wall and sliding down afterwards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t really know what Vim is all about. All they know is that it’s a text editor sitting in almost every platform and that one can use it to for example editing a file on a remote server. Vim is a lot more. I know, it’s not as easy to use as other editors and IDE’s, but once you get used to it, you don’t want to work without it anymore. &lt;a href=&quot;#figure-1&quot; title=&quot;Link to figure 1&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; shows the way how I think how steep the learning curve of Vim is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&quot;figure-1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Figure that represents Vim&apos;s learning curve&quot; src=&quot;/media/vim-learn-curve.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: The Vim learning curve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it’s not a curve at all. It’s a wall. But you also see, once you climbed that wall, you can lean back and slide down on the other side. So what do I try to say with this relatively lovely figure of Vim’s learning &lt;del&gt;curve&lt;/del&gt; wall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes. It is true that it’s really hard to get started with this editor. You have to understand its &lt;a href=&quot;#its-a-modal-editor&quot; title=&quot;Link to modal behaviour section&quot;&gt;modal behavior&lt;/a&gt;, you have to learn a bunch of &lt;a title=&quot;Link to text objects section&quot; href=&quot;#text-objects-and-motions&quot;&gt;key bindings&lt;/a&gt;, you even have to stick with a textual user interface. However, once you learned the fundamentals of Vim you’ll notice that the original idea behind this editor is actually quite clever and that you’re probably much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a mouse, you push yourself to use as few key strokes as possible to do your operations (which again makes you faster), you learn how to customize the &lt;strong&gt;entire&lt;/strong&gt; editor that it fits to your preferences and you finally become a Vim power user and only leave it when it’s really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed that wall and it took me weeks to get used to the basic things like editing files, opening different files etc. Back in the days I switched from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/&quot; title=&quot;Eclipse website&quot;&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; to Vim. You probably agree that this IDE is slow by default. But despite from that, once I was able to do some basic operations in Vim and actually started working again, I made almost as twice as much progress at work in about half the time. I know that sounds kind of crazy but I’m serious. And that convinced me that I made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do yourself a favor and climb that mountain. Just remember that you can slide down afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-a-modal-editor&quot;&gt;It&apos;s a modal editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t even think of navigating with the mouse through files and folders anymore. Navigating with the keyboard is just way faster. Moving away your hand from the home row to the mouse takes too long. But how is it possible to navigate with the keyboard without typing directly into file you ask? Well, Vim doesn’t insert into files unless you tell him to do so. It’s a modal editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s another fact that makes me love Vim. It has different modes. There’s &lt;em&gt;Normal Mode&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Insert Mode&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Command Mode&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Visual Mode&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ex Mode&lt;/em&gt; to name a few. Each key on the keyboard has a different meaning in each mode. Now, it probably sounds like too many things to keep in your head and you might be right about that, but learning Vim is not about starting from 0 to 100. Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;#figure-1&quot;&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, as far as I know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; has even a mode for each file type/language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal mode is the mode you hang around most of your time. It’s for navigating and editing text. Even if you can use the mouse or arrow keys to get from one place to another, you actually don’t want to do that because it’s a waste of time. The basic navigation keys in Vim that correspond to the arrow keys are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;. Looking at these letters they seem to be just letters right? Now take a look at your keyboard and see where these letters are placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. There’s no place like home row. Now compare it to where the arrow keys are placed (Yes, they are too far away!). Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; alone doesn’t really do the trick right? It’s like using arrow keys but from the home row. Vim is very neat when it comes to combine &lt;a href=&quot;#text-objects-and-motions&quot;&gt;motions&lt;/a&gt; with a count. For example you can simply prefix the keys with a count like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;5j&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;9k&lt;/code&gt;, which executes the motion accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; which brings you to the top of the window, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; which brings you to the middle and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; which puts your cursor in the last line. Motions work everywhere in Vim. So for example if you are in Visual Mode to select a range of text, you can use any kind of motion to do so. Selecting everything from top to the 26th line of the file could be achieved with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ggV26G&lt;/code&gt; when starting from Normal Mode. Is that easy? Of course there are much more motions and features to move around in Vim. Simply google for &lt;em&gt;marks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;jumps&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;text-objects&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of how fast you can navigate in Vim, watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zIOOLZJb87U&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll get into some other powerful motions in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does one insert text like in any other editor and IDE? Well, in Vim everything is just a few key strokes away. To insert text into a file, you first have to switch to Insert Mode. You get there by simply typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; in Normal Mode. From there you can type anything you want and it gets inserted into the Buffer. You get out and switch to Normal Mode again by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Even if that’s pretty intuitive, it turns out that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; key is far away from the home row. No problem. Simply map something else to escape from Insert Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to select a range of text to operate on it, you simply switch to Visual Mode by typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; for character-wise or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; for line-wise selection. From there you can use any kind of motions to select a range. Switching to Normal Mode again, is as easy as hitting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; key. Vim even comes with a &lt;em&gt;Visual-Block Mode&lt;/em&gt; out of the box, which let’s you select ranges of text vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it sounds very uncomfortable to switch between modes all the time, once you get into it you’ll see that it’s actually very intuitive and that you are much faster when working with a few key strokes instead of reaching out to the mouse, scrolling around, finding the place you want to put the cursor and finally trying to be as precise as possible to hit that target. In addition, like I said, you actually spend most of the time in Normal Mode. The less you have to switch modes to edit your text the better and faster you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;text-objects-and-motions&quot;&gt;Text-objects and motions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim comes with a two features that I haven’t seen in any other editor yet. Taking a look at the headline doesn’t make it hard to guess what features I’m talking about. Exactly, I’m talking about text-objects and motions. Now what the hell are they and why are these two guys another reason I love Vim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motions are in most cases the second part of an entire command you want to execute when working with Vim. You apply them during the so called &lt;strong&gt;Operator-Pending Mode&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the little time frame where you apply a “target” to built-in commands such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s say you want to delete from the current cursor position &lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; the next occurrence of the letter &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;. You do that with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; command which brings your cursor in front of the next occurrence of the given characer. So typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dtr&lt;/code&gt; in Normal Mode could be read as &lt;em&gt;Delete until next ‘r’&lt;/em&gt;. The basic pattern of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; command is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;d{motion}&lt;/code&gt; and you can use any kind of motion there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text-objects can be used in context of motions. They are a bit more clever than normal motions because they can act in both “directions.” For example, whereas the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; command in Normal Mode is a motion to jump to the next word, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;iw&lt;/code&gt; is a text-object that operates &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the current word. Where “inside” means “this word excluding the surrounding spaces”. So, to delete a word you can compose commands like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;diw&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;daw&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; a word. There are text-objects for paragraphs (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt;), sentences (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;), HTML tags (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;it&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;) and Vim is even smart enough to act on the current function block (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i{&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a{&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of Vim’s built-in text objects. Also, the examples I gave here are just very simple scenarios, I think you can imagine how powerful these commands could be when working on bigger texts and codes. In the end it’s all about composability. Vim gives you literally a grammar so that you can edit your text with the speed of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other editors try to bring Vim functionality into their environments. For example the editor Sublime Text has an optional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vintage Mode&lt;/a&gt;. The recently launched editor by GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;http://atom.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; has a vim-mode too. However none of these additional modes can really give you what Vim gives you. Apart from the fact that Vim has over 20 years of knowledge inside with loads of built-in features I didn’t even know yet, key features like operator-pending key mappings are things that let me keep using Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this great article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/programming-ideas-tutorial-and-experience/433852f4b4d1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;why Atom can’t replace Vim&lt;/a&gt; popping up recently, you really should read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;However, that’s all I have.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on some feedback I got, I’m adding a few links to resources here that I find very useful and maybe help you out getting started with Vim too.&lt;/p&gt;
